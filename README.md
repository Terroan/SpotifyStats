Simple overview for my spotify stats. Created with the JS-framework "React" and published on Netlify.

# Goal
The goal of the project was to use the spotify API to get my personal stats like top songs and give the option to sign in and create a playlist on someones account. 

# Problem
Right now the button "Create Playlist" is deactivated because my API is still in Developer Mode and Spotify must accept my request first in order to make extern users possible.

# Live
The website is currently live at: https://danispotify.site
